Why did I not think of this for the /tmp - tmpfs issue?

Is it plausible to have /tmp =3D tmpfs with a service that depends on
/tmp that mounts /tmp/whatever to /opt/product/workspace on boot?

If I can setup such a scheme in a reliable way, I think that I can
workaround the problems I mentioned with legacy products wanting to
write files to /tmp (and persist there)

This would not be possible if tmpfs does not allow bind to harddisk
locations

Am I being too terse?
