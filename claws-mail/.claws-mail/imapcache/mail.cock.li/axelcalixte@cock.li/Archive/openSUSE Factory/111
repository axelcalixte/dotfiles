It works because these are symbolic links which ought to be symbolic
links according to the package's source rpm/spec file. Think of an rpm
as a defined set of files/directories/links, where each of them carry
another defined set of information such as who owns it (user/group id),
permissions, etc. When you run "rpm -V filesystem" and you've modified
/home and /root/bin, you'll get warnings as the integrity of that
package is no longer maintained. Please have a look at "man rpm" and
search for "VERIFY OPTIONS" which will show what this
integrity/consistency actually means.

It surely can be discussed if /home actually should be owned by a
package, but, as others have argued, it plays an established role in the
Linux/UNIX FHS and therefore has to be created according to some proper
rules. These rules say that it is a directory, owned by root:root with
permission 755! When you want/need a different device to carry your
/home directory, you can either bind-mount another directory (as I
suggested in my initial reply), or bind a different block device to
/home. This way rpm wouldn't complain about any inconsistency. So, if
your HOME directories should live on a partition of your second disk
/dev/sdb, you could use something like this:

  - Use fdisk or parted (or your preferred partition tool) to create
    such a partition with your preferred file system type; ideally you
    assign it a unique label such as HOME
  - Then you could mount your home directory using something like
    LABEL=3DHOME	/home	auto	defaults	1 2

I guess, your /home.server is already mounted like this. So, you could
just replace /home.server in the line of your /etc/fstab with /home. No
need for a symbolic link at all ;)

HTH, cheers.
