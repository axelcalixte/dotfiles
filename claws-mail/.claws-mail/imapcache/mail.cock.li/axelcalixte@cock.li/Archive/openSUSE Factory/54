You did run inxi to generate this after a full X restart, right? If so, then there
may be a configuration file specifying use of the modesetting driver, or
/etc/X11/xorg_pci_ids/modesetting_ids is more than 2 bytes and specifying an
override. Does /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf exist and contain uncommented
lines, including one that specifies modesetting as device? If not, is there some
other file specifying modesetting? If not, maybe you should susepaste
/var/log/Xorg.0.log for us to examine.
