Hi all,

I have 6 VMs in our infrastructure in our infrastructure running
openSUSE MicroOS. They are all used as Docker host.
This morning they were all unreachable. I could not reach them via ping
and of course not login via SSH.
In the VNC console I saw boot messages indicating that systemd-logind
and chronyd were not able to start correctly. We were in a rush today
so I did not take time to investigate and simply roll back, services
were back online.

After that I cloned one of the VMs, upgraded, encountered the same
issue. I was able to login via VNC console and found that the whole
system was read-only. As a consequence no services could write their
PIDs or other start up information.

I would like to fill a bug report but I am not sure against which
component so any hint would be appreciated. Is there currently issues
with MicroOS / transactional-update that I might have not found in
mailing list/bugzilla ? 

Regards,
