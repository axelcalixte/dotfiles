After the upgrade that comes with Emacs-27 things are not working too
well.  Emacs startup seems to be from source instead of byte-compiled
file or a portable dump, suddenly uses the X11 backend instead of Xft or
whatever Harfbuzz is supposed to use (with horrible font display that
has no antialiasing, but still tries to scale the font) and Gnus doesn't
even start and instead leaves this message:

load-history-filename-element: Wrong type argument: stringp, (require . info)

Similar messages are output for most of the other major modes I use, but
I don't know where things have gone wrong.

I found that I get things to work when starting Emacs as 'emacs -Q' (it
then uses the Harfbuzz font backend as expected) and I can manually load
my startup files later on and have it working (as far as I could quickly
test it).  I can use that as a temporary workaround for a few days
probably.

It does ostensibly not work when I start it with 'emacs -q -nsl
--no-splash --name bork' (the latter is to avoid pulling in any X
resources targeted at emacs).  So it doesn't seem to be my own startup
files, but rather sopmething pretty early in the startup sequence that
-Q suppresses fortunately.


Regards,
Achim.
