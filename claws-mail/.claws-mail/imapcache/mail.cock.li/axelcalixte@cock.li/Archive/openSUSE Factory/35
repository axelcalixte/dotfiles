Most installations include this. Did you start with a minimal installation and
keep recommends disabled? It's a small and useful utility for X diagnosis.

That's how it has always worked for me. /etc/X11/xorg_pci_ids/modesetting_ids
supposedly exists to be able to override it, but it has only ever been a 2 byte
placeholder for me.

I didn't know it existed. I suppose Wine users might benefit from it.
