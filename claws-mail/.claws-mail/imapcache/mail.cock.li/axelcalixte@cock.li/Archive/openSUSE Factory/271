==== dbus-1 ====
Version update (1.12.16 -> 1.12.20)
Subpackages: libdbus-1-3 libdbus-1-3-32bit

- Update to 1.12.20
  * On Unix, avoid a use-after-free if two usernames have the same
    numeric uid. In older versions this could lead to a crash (denial of
    service) or other undefined behaviour, possibly including incorrect
    authorization decisions if <policy group=...> is used.
    Like Unix filesystems, D-Bus' model of identity cannot distinguish
    between users of different names with the same numeric uid, so this
    configuration is not advisable on systems where D-Bus will be used.
    Thanks to Daniel Onaca.
    (dbus#305, dbus!166; Simon McVittie)
- From 1.12.18
  * CVE-2020-12049: If a message contains more file descriptors than can
    be sent, close those that did get through before reporting error.
    Previously, a local attacker could cause the system dbus-daemon (or
    another system service with its own DBusServer) to run out of file
    descriptors, by repeatedly connecting to the server and sending fds that
    would get leaked.
    Thanks to Kevin Backhouse of GitHub Security Lab.
    (dbus#294, GHSL-2020-057; Simon McVittie)
  * Fix a crash when the dbus-daemon is terminated while one or more
    monitors are active (dbus#291, dbus!140; Simon McVittie)
  * The dbus-send(1) man page now documents --bus and --peer instead of
    the old --address synonym for --peer, which has been deprecated since
  the introduction of --bus and --peer in 1.7.6
  (fd.o #48816, dbus!115; Chris Morin)
  * Fix a wrong environment variable name in dbus-daemon(1)
    (dbus#275, dbus!122; Mubin, Philip Withnall)
  * Fix formatting of dbus_message_append_args example
  (dbus!126, Felipe Franciosi)
  * Avoid a test failure on Linux when built in a container as uid 0, but
    without the necessary privileges to increase resource limits
  (dbus!58, Debian #908092; Simon McVittie)
  * When building with CMake, cope with libX11 in a non-standard location
  (dbus!129, Tuomo Rinne)
- Run spec-cleaner
- Move generation of API docs to a separate package, avoid doxygen
  dependency for building main package.
- Build x11 and devel-doc (API doc) using _multibuild.
- Drop no longer required call to autoreconf, remove obsolete
  BuildRequires for libtool and autoconf-archive.
