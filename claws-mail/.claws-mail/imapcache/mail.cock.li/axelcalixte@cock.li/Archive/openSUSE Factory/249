openSUSE-release-20200810-660.1.x86_64 -> openSUSE-release-20200817-666.1.x86_64

The system complains about missing MokManager.efi very early during
boot.

/boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi
/boot/efi/EFI/boot/fallback.efi
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/MokManager.efi
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/boot.csv
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grub.cfg
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grub.efi
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grubx64.efi
/boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/shim.efi

Booting EFI/boot/bootx64.efi reproduces the error, booting
EFI/opensuse/shim.efi loads the system.

A couple of problems here:

1) the BIOS is not instructed to load the correct binary
2) the fallback does not work

Is this expected/known issue?

Thanks

Michal
