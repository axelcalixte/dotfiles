Just use bind mounts if this a regular user app
 or systemd unit setting TemporaryFileSystem= if this is a service.

I assume that this legacy products cannot be fixed...because it they
could be..you better do that and operate under the expected
constraints: "programs should not assume that files in /tmp persist
between invocations" (currently the system is forgiving and will
persist until next reboot (unless it is a system service with
privatetmp on) but again nothing should depend on this
implementation-specific detail)
