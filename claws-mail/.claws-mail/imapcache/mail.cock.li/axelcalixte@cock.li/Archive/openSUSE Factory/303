    gifecho, giffilter, gifinto, gifsponge. These were either installed in
    error or have been obsolesced by modern image-transformmation tools
    like ImageMagick convert. They may be removed entirely in a future
    release.

==== hyper-v ====

- Allow daemon restart again (bsc#1116957)
  Since some time the kernel moved from netlink sockets to char
  devices, which is supposed to handle a connection reopen for the
  kernel<->daemon interface

==== json-c ====
Version update (0.14 -> 0.15)
Subpackages: libjson-c5 libjson-c5-32bit

- update to 0.15:
  * Deprecate `array_list_new()` in favor of `array_list_new2()`
  * Remove the THIS_FUNCTION_IS_DEPRECATED define.
  * Remove config.h.win32
  * Add a `JSON_TOKENER_ALLOW_TRAILING_CHARS` flag to allow multiple objects
    to be parsed even when `JSON_TOKENER_STRICT` is set.
  * Add `json_object_new_array_ext(int)` and `array_list_new_2(int)` to allow
    arrays to be allocated with the exact size needed, when known.
  * Add `json_object_array_shrink()` (and `array_list_shrink()`) and use it in
    json_tokener to minimize the amount of memory used.
  * Add a json_parse binary, for use in testing changes (not installed, but
    available in the apps directory).
  * Split the internal json_object structure into several sub-types, one for
    each json_type (json_object_object, json_object_string, etc...).
    This improves memory usage and speed, with the benchmark under
    bench/ report 5.8% faster test time and 6%(max RSS)-12%(peak heap)
    less memory usage.
    Memory used just for json_object structures decreased 27%, so use cases
    with fewer arrays and/or strings would benefit more.
  * Minimize memory usage in array handling in json_tokener by shrinking
    arrays to the exact number of elements parsed.  On bench/ benchmark:
    9% faster test time, 39%(max RSS)-50%(peak heap) less memory usage.
    Add json_object_array_shrink() and array_list_shrink() functions.
  * #616 - Parsing of surrogate pairs in unicode escapes now properly handles
    incremental parsing.
  * Fix incremental parsing of numbers, especially those with exponents, e.g.
    so parsing "[0", "e+", "-]" now properly returns an error.
    Strict mode now rejects missing exponents ("0e").
  * Successfully return number objects at the top level even when they are
    followed by a "-", "." or "e".  This makes parsing things like "123-45"
    behave consistently with things like "123xyz".
  * #589 - Detect broken RDRAND during initialization; also, fix segfault
    in the CPUID check.
  * #592 - Fix integer overflows to prevert out of bounds write on large input.
  * Protect against division by zero in linkhash, when creaed with zero size.
  * #602 - Fix json_parse_uint64() internal error checking, leaving the retval
    untouched in more failure cases.
  * #614 - Prevent truncation when custom double formatters insert extra \0's
- remove 0001-Detect-broken-RDRAND-during-initialization.patch (upstream)

  * Use size_t for malloc sizes

==== polari ====
Subpackages: polari-lang typelib-1_0-Polari-1_0

- Drop mozjs68 BuildRequires: it is only required to syntax check
  the .js files during build. As we use pristine upstream sources,
  we can assume them to be tested by the CI already.

==== python-kiwi ====
Version update (9.21.3 -> 9.21.7)

- Bump version: 9.21.6 ? 9.21.7
- Fixed archlinux integration test build
  The setup of the locale via systemd-firstboot --locale=en_US.UTF-8
  failed on archlinux with the error message Locale en_US.UTF-8 is not
  installed. This commit sets the locale explicitly
- Fixed GCE integration test build
  nothing provides google-compute-engine-init
- Fixed bootloader grub copy SameFileError exception
  Only copy the file if the given source and destination are
  not the same file
- Simplify build_status helper
  Instead of a static list with all integration test build names
  only maintain a list of integration test build project names
- Bump version: 9.21.5 ? 9.21.6
- Skip filesystem check for XFS prior xfs_grow
  running xfs_repair check isn't strictly necessary before resizing,
  and in some cases it may even prevent resizing by giving an error
  that would be cleared through mounting the fs (e.g. when the fs
  wasn't cleanly umounted, and thus letting xfs recover and replay
  its journal). Given that xfs can only grow online (while being mounted),
  this is sufficient to ensure that the fs is in a state where it
  can be resized. This is related to bsc#1174009
- Fixed code logic in resize_filesystem method
  resize_filesystem runs fs-check on the filesytem prior to
  resize. This check however should not be done if the filesystem
  got deployed on a ramdisk. For that purpose the _is_ramdisk_device
  method exists. The logic in the method as well as the call
  were wrong. This in the end lead to a correct logic but is
  completely confusing. This commit fixes and simplifies the
  _is_ramdisk_device method and corrects the caller logic
- Make sure kernel options are respected by grub
  Set options variable in grub loader/entries to match the
  kiwi image description setup. This adaption currently
  happens only when building in OBS because in this env
  the options setup done by grub is a complete mess.
- Fixed root replace for grub menu entries
  The root device spec in the grub boot/loader/entries/*.conf
  files when building in OBS is not matching the loop mapped
  image root device but matches the root device of the OBS worker.
  Very strange behavior and of course wrong. Because of that
  the expression to replace the wrong device with the correct
  one must be a regular expression and cannot be based on the
  loop mapped image root device.
- Fixed path to search for grub menu entries
- Fixed scope of remove_hierarchy
  The remove_hierarchy method walked through the entire path
  it was given. That included the root path which is beyond
  its scope. This Fixes #1515
- Fixed corrections in BootLoaderSpec grub config
  Distributions like Fedora RawHide or CentOS8 applies to the
  grub BootLoaderSpec as described here:
  https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/BootLoaderSpec
  Part of the spec is that menu entries are handled in extra files
  below /boot/loader/entries. Unfortunately the grub2-mkconfig code
  has still no clue how to find the correct root device in special
  environments like obs workers or in overlay systems. To fixup the
  result of grub2-mkconfig there is code in kiwi which needs to be
  adapted because the file that contains the wrong information is
  now no longer grub.cfg but some /boot/loader/entries/*.conf file.
  This commit solves the issue.
- Fixed grub setup in EFI/BOOT directory
  kiwi copied the same grub.cfg file as it exists in boot/grub2
  to the efi path. This is wrong as the setup in the efi boot
  directory is used to enable normal grub loading and not providing
  the user grub configuration. In addition the changes here makes
  sure that the early grub boot code is placed into the system
  in any EFI case except for secure boot when shim-install is
  present. If shim-install is present it also creates the early
  grub boot setup such that kiwi doesn't have to do it.
  This Fixes #1491 and Fixes bsc#1172908
- Use rsync in inplace transfer mode
  Using the --inplace option in rsync helps to save space on
  syncing the rootfs data and prevents e.g OBS workers from
  running out of VM space when transfering root filesystem
  data. Also using --inplace allows to keep hardlinks intact.
  This is related to bsc#1096738
- Don't keep copy of grub2-install in the system
  To prevent shim-install from calling grub2-install in uefi mode
  kiwi temporary replaces the tool by a noop. This acts as a
  workaround for an issue in shim-install. However the workaround
  left a file copy of grub2-install in the system which should
  not happen. This commit Fixes bsc#1173226 and Fixes #1490
- Rename CentOS 7 test and add CentOS 8 test
  This commit renames the CentOS 7 test and adds a new CentOS 8 test
  Related to #1468
- Update Ubuntu and Debian image tests
  This commit updates Ubuntu test to Focal distribution and adds an
  additional Debian Buster image test.
  Related to #1468
- Include CentOS vendor in grub2 configuration
  This commit ensures the vendor files for grubenv consider CentOS
  vendoring.
- Fixed documentation for OEM swap partition
  A swap partition in an OEM deployment is only created if
  that is explicitly requested via the oem-swap element
- Bump version: 9.21.4 ? 9.21.5
- Do not create a md5 checksum output file for archive images
  This commit removes the creation of the md5 file that includes a
  checksum of the image binary for the `tbz` image type. Removing it
  as this is the only image type that includes it as part of the result
  and because the bundle procedure already creates a sha256 file out of
  the results, so there is still the chance to produce validation
  checksums.
- Document output files KIWI produces
  This commits adds a chapter to describe the ouput files that are part
  of any image build.
- Fixed oem recovery tar parameter order
  Reorder tar parameters
  When building an oem-image with oem-recovery set to true a tar error appears saying:
  "The following options were used after any non-optional arguments in archive create or
  update mode". This commit fixes the order of arguments to tar to avoid the error condition.
  Fixes #1501
- Fixed tox min version
- Cleanup setup.py
  The way kiwi uses setup.py assumes that pip runs this script
  like a spec file in rpm is processed. However this is not the
  case given that pip implicitly creates a static zip file called
  wheel which looses all the code logic done in setup.py. Therefore
  setup.py should not contain code that needs to run at install
  time. Of course this change comes with an effect which is that
  the following files will not be available when installing kiwi
  from pip:
  * man pages: /usr/share/man/man8/...
  * command completion: /etc/bash_completion.d/kiwi-ng.sh
  * kiwi default config file: /etc/kiwi.yml
  * package docs: /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi-ng/...
  (kiwi.pdf, LICENSE, README)
  kiwi stays fully functional without this information. It is
  expected that the installation of kiwi as a service will
  be done by a package and its package manager. When using kiwi
  from pip it is designed to provide a python module but not
  a complete user application. The way pip and wheels interact
  with each other seems to demonstrate that pip is not a
  package manager but more a python module manager.
  This Fixes #1415
- Describe targets in tox.ini
  * Make use of description to show them with "tox -av"
  * Use comments as "description" lines
  * Define minimal tox version (3.5.0)
- Bump version: 9.21.3 ? 9.21.4
- Refactor FileSystem Factory
  With regards to Issue #1486 a discussion came up that the
  way factories are implemented are questionable when thinking
  about strong typing for the public kiwi interface. This
  commit refactors the FileSystem factory to be a real factory
  and to add type hints such that its use from an api perspective
  is clear and enforced.
