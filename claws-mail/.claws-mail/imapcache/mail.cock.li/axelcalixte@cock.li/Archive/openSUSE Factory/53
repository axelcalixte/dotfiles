I checked

=E2=80=A2 Using btrfs? No
=E2=80=A2 Mounted?     No

$ di /tmp/
Filesystem       Mount       Size     Used    Avail %Used  fs Type
/dev/nvme0n1p6   /         220.7G    42.4G   178.3G   19%  xfs

$ sudo systemctl disable tmp.mount
Unit /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount is masked, ignoring.

Uh Oh, now I don't know what to do to prevent /tmp turning into tmpfs
