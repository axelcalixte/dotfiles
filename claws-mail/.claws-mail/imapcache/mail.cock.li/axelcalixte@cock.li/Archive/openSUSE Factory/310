Hi,

FYI: Virtualbox 6.1.97, fetched from SVN, and built here:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:frispete:kernel/virtualbox
does work including USB-{2,3} support, given the extpack r140056 from 
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Testbuilds is installed properly.

No kernel patching nor driver patching necessary. 
Well, internally, I'm using (an unpatched) kernel 5.8.3 from stable tree, but 
apart from USB-{2,3} support, that was missing due to an extpack mismatch, 
this was tested with 5.8.0 as well.

If some of you guys are using this, please give feedback.
I found Klaus Espenlaub from Oracle pretty responsive in this issue.

An official release will take some more time due to some other issues.

Cheers,
Pete
