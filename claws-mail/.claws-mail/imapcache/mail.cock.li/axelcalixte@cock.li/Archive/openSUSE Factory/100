It is even worse for one product: it supports $TMPDIR (yeah) but not
for all files used (WTF?). Another issue I need sudo for is that it
requires a hard-coded path in /usr. I need to make a symbolic link
there to escape of that idiot stupidity.

As the company of that product does not exist anymore (at least not
in terms of maint or support) there is no chance of getting that fixed

I will investigate bind mounts!
