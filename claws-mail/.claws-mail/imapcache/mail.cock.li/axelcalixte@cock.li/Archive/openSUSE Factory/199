  Hi,

I juste DUPed my laptop to TW 20200813, including kernel 5.8.0

Unfortunately, the nvidia modules (440.82) don't compile.  I get

/var/lib/dkms/nvidia/440.82/build/common/inc/nv-linux.h:512:17: error: too many arguments to function ‘__vmalloc’

Googling only found
https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problems-installing-drivers-for-geforce-gtx-1660-super/13992,
but no patch/solution.

Was anyone more successful?
