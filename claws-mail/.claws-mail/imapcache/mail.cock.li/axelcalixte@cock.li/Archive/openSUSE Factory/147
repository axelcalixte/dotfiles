During the latest two weeks the YaST Team has fixed quite some bugs in
(Auto)YaST, but we also has done more interesting stuff you can find in
our usual report, including:

- Documenting the current handling of the AutoYaST profile.
- Removing an undocumented AutoYaST feature for creating images.
- Improvements regarding I/O devices auto-configuration on s390.
- Support for exporting the AutoYaST firewall section in compact format.
- Some reduction in the size of the system images used by the installer.
- Updating the documentation of mk_image.
- Fixes in the Service Manager section of the AutoYaST UI.
- Making YaST deal with the dual location of /usr/etc/nsswitch.conf
  and /etc/nsswitch.conf.
- Unified and more configurable layout for both the installer and YaST
  Firstboot.

Check the extended versions with links and some screenshots at

Cheers.
