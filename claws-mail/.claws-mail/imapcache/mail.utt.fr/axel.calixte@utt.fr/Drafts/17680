Hello,

Signal seems really good but I have two different requests to probably mak=
e it better for people like me who have a limited number of contacts on Sig=
nal=2E

1=2E Create an option to disable syncing services of Signal messages=2E so=
 that it can be used as a regular sms app without using too much battery=2E=
 (I don't have Google Services so maybe that's why I have an issue)

2=2E Even with Google Services this time, SMS messages written and sent fr=
om Signal doesn't appear in other messaging SMS applications=2E I don't kno=
w why that is but that really bothers me 'cause I can't use and backup my S=
MS if I use Signal=2E

These things would make me use the app even with NO contacts on Signal wha=
tsoever and I'd be glad to promote the app or see about new Signal users in=
 my contact list because it would always be on my phone as the main sms app=
=2E

I hope my point is understandable=2E
