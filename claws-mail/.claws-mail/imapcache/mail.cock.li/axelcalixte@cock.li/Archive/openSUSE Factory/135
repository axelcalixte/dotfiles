Please DUP to 0803 - aaa_base has been reverted already in that
snapshot and a new version with the issue fixed is in the queue.

Besides that, the error has no negative impacts on your system: it's a
preparation for moving some more distro files to /usr/etc, which was
not completley done right. But as there is nothing in
/usr/etc/profiles.d yet, no bad things happened neither.

Cheers,
