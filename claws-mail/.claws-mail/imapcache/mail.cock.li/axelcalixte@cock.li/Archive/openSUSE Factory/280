Hi,


Looks like on current Tumbleweed, we have an issue with `systemctl show` 
running into `Failed to parse bus message: Invalid argument` and not 
showing all it should show, which I noticed because one of my tools 
fails because it can't find `ActiveState`.

A bit of searching leads to 
https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg1759127.html 
and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1853736

So, this is caused by running kernel 5.8 with a a systemd compiled 
against an older kernel version, and openSUSE can either fix this by 
rebuilding systemd or in addition also upgrading systemd to include the 
upstream fix mentioned in the RedHat bug.

Should I file a bug on this?

Cheers,
Robert Kaiser
