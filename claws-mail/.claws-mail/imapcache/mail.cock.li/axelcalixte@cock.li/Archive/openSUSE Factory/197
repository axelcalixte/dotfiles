  several bug fixes. See https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.4.9

==== python-cffi ====
Version update (1.14.0 -> 1.14.1)

- update to 1.14.1:
  * CFFI source code is now hosted on Heptapod.
  * Improved support for typedef int my_array_t[...]; with an explicit dot-dot-dot in API mode (issue #453)
  * Windows (32 and 64 bits): multiple fixes for ABI-mode call to functions that return a structure.
  * Experimental support for MacOS 11 on aarch64.
  * and a few other minor changes and bug fixes.

==== python-dnspython ====
Version update (1.16.0 -> 2.0.0)

- Disable four tests which fail on openssl 1.1.0i and lower
- Add missing dependency requests-toolkit, and recommend
  cryptography
- remove test depending on trio, which depends on Python 3.7 if python >= 3.7 is not available.
- update to 2.0.0:
  - Python 3.6 or newer is required.
  - The license is now the ISC license.
  - Rdata is now immutable. Use dns.rdata.Rdata.replace() to make a new Rdata based on an existing one.
  - dns.resolver.resolve() has been added, allowing control of whether search lists are used. dns.resolver.query() is retained for backwards compatibility, but deprecated. The default for search list behavior can be set at in the resolver object with the use_search_by_default parameter. The default is False.
  - DNS-over-TLS is supported with dns.query.tls().
  - DNS-over-HTTPS is supported with dns.query.https(), and the resolver will use DNS-over-HTTPS for a nameserver which is an HTTPS URL.
  - Basic query and resolver support for the Trio, Curio, and asyncio asynchronous I/O libraries has been added in dns.asyncquery and dns.asyncresolver. This API should be viewed as experimental as asynchronous I/O support in dnspython is still evolving.
  - TSIG now defaults to using SHA-256.
  - Basic type info has been added to some functions. Future releases will have comprehensive type info.
  - from_text() functions now have a relativize_to parameter.
  - python-cryptography is now used for DNSSEC.
  - Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are now supported.
  - A helper for NSEC3 generating hashes has been added.
  - SHA384 DS records are supported.
  - Rdatasets and RRsets are much faster.
  - dns.resolver.resolve_address() has been added, allowing easy address-to-name lookups.
  - dns.reversename functions now allow an alternate origin to be specified.
  - The repr form of Rdatasets and RRsets now includes the rdata.
  - A number of standard resolv.conf options are now parsed.
  - The nameserver and port used to get a response are now part of the resolver?s Answer object.
  - The NINFO record is supported.
  - The dns.hash module has been removed; just use Python?s native hashlib module.
  - Rounding is done in the standard python 3 fashion; dnspython 1.x rounded in the python 2 style on both python 2 and 3.
  - The resolver will now do negative caching if a cache has been configured.
  - TSIG and OPT now have rdata types.
  - The class for query messages is now QueryMessage. Class Message is now a base class, and is also used for messages for which we don?t have a better class. Update messages are now class UpdateMessage, though class Update is retained for compatibility.
  - Support for Windows 95, 98, and ME has been removed.

  * Added index hinting support to the ReplaceOne, UpdateOne, UpdateMany, DeleteOne, and DeleteMany bulk operations.
  * Added support for bson.binary.UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED and MongoClient(uuidRepresentation='unspecified') which will become the default UUID representation starting in PyMongo 4.0. See Handling UUID Data for details.
  * Added the background parameter to pymongo.database.Database.validate_collection(). For a description of this parameter see the MongoDB documentation for the validate command.
  * Added the allow_disk_use parameters to pymongo.collection.Collection.find().
  * Added the hedge parameter to PrimaryPreferred, Secondary, SecondaryPreferred, Nearest to support disabling (or explicitly enabling) hedged reads in MongoDB 4.4+.
