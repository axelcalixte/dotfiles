If you need a symlink home -> /home.server/ I would suggest to use a
bind mount instead of a symlink. Two reasons:

  * Many programs use files in $HOME and many of them could not deal
    consistently with symlinks. For instance they write pathes like
    /home.server/user/some-file1 and /home/user/some-file2 in config files.
  * Bind mounts will not result in errors like you described. Offline
    updates (from CDROM, ISO) may still be an issue. I haven't tested,
    if the Installer uses the bind mounts from /etc/fstab.

Greetings,
Bj√∂rn
