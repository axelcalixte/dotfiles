Hi,

when cleaning up filesystem.rpm, I found two directories which nothing seems
to use them anymore and where I don't know for what they are good:

- /etc/sysconfig/scripts - I couldn't find any reference to this
- /etc/sysconfig/network/providers - seems to be used by smpppd for T-DSL
  a very long time ago.

Does anybody know if they are still in use and for what? Else I would
remove them with the next cleanup round.

  Thorsten
