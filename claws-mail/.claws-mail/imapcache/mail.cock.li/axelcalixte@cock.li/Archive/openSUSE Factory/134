After the aaa_base update I get this error when I start a shell (login,
sudo ...):

# sudo -i
-bash: test: too many arguments

The reason is that /usr/etc/profile.d/ does not exists and the following
code results in this error

# vi +307 /etc/profile
[...]
    for s in /usr/etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
        test -e /etc/profile.d/${s##*/} && continue
        test -r $s -a ! -k $s && . $s
    done
[...]

Greetings,
Björn
