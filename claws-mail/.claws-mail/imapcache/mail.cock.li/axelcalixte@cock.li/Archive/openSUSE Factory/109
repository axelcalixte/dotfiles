OK, thats the hard methode, but then only for "filesystem" rpm
I changed it a little bit and search for SymLinks

# rpm -ql filesystem | while read dir; do [ -h $dir ] && echo $dir; done
/var/mail
/var/run

Seems that there are some default directories which are linked.
Why this are working?

Yes, but from my point of view, a System must be tolerant according to
such case of (possible or not forbidden) issues.
