Hello guys:

Problem: libshaderc_shared1-2020.0-1.3.x86_64 requires 
libSPIRV-Tools-opt.so.suse17()(64bit), but this requirement cannot be 
provided
   deleted providers: libSPIRV-Tools-suse18-2020.3-1.2.x86_64
  Solution 1: Following actions will be done:
   deinstallation of libshaderc_shared1-2020.0-1.3.x86_64
   deinstallation of 
mpv-bash-completion-0.32.0+git.20200802T170651.fb55ee99e3-1.1.noarch
   deinstallation of smplayer-skins-15.2.0-1.5.noarch
   deinstallation of smplayer-lang-20.4.2-1.3.noarch
  Solution 2: keep obsolete libSPIRV-Tools-suse18-2020.3-1.2.x86_64
  Solution 3: break libshaderc_shared1-2020.0-1.3.x86_64 by ignoring 
some of its dependencies


I think that libshaderc_shared needs to be rebuilded against new 
libSPIRV-Tools

Daniele.
