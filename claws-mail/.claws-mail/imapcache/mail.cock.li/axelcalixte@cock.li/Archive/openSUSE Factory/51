For me it does work that way, at least for the normal Xorg.  There, intel has
higher priority than modesetting, and just by having xf86-video-intel
installed it uses it (32bit isn't needed in my case).  /var/log/Xorg.0.log
confirms that intel is used (see excerpt below).  This is with a HD530
(Skylake) GPU. 

But you seem to use Wayland?  No idea how that works, and which logs are
created there...
