Hi,

Just a note to let you know that systemd is going to stop pulling in
'sysvinit-tools' package. The dep was added back in 2014 for vhangup(8) but it
was no longer used, see [1] for the details.

That might break packages that ignored to specify their dependencies on the
tools shipped by 'sysvinit-tools' (such as pidof).

Please make sure to add back the dep if your packages fall into this category.

Thanks
