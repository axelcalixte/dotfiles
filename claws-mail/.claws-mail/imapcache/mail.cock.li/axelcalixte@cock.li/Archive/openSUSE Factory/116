Hi Rainer,

Thanks for your email

Because this change stops putting that mount unit in that obscure
location and relocates it to the expected upstream location, I've
updated the /tmp on tmpfs wikipage for the steps you'll need to take
when this change goes live so you can have exactly the same as a fresh
default going forward

https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Tmp_on_tmpfs

Hope this helps
