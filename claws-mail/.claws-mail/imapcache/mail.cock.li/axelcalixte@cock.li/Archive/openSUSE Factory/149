  * GH#426: The Shamir's secret sharing implementation is not actually compatible with ``ssss``.
  Added an optional parameter to enable interoperability.
  * GH#427: Skip altogether loading of ``gmp.dll`` on Windows.
  * GH#420: Fix incorrect CFB decryption when the input and the output are the same buffer.
  * Speed up Shamir's secret sharing routines. Thanks to ncarve.

- update to version 19.0.2:
  - Regenerate Cython sources with 0.29.21 in sdists for compatibility with Python 3.9
  - Handle underlying socket being closed in ZMQStream with warning instead of error
  - Improvements to socket cleanup during process teardown
  - Fix debug-builds on Windows
  - Avoid importing ctypes during startup on Windows
  - Documentation improvements
  - Raise ``AttributeError`` instead of ``ZMQError(EINVAL)`` on attempts to read write-only attributes,
    for compatibility with mocking

==== python-redis ====
Version update (3.4.1 -> 3.5.3)

- update to 3.5.3
  * Restore try/except clauses to __del__ methods. These will be removed
    in 4.0 when more explicit resource management if enforced. #1339
  * Update the master_address when Sentinels promote a new master. #847
  * Update SentinelConnectionPool to not forcefully disconnect other in-use
    connections which can negatively affect threaded applications. #1345
  3.5.2
  * Tune the locking in ConnectionPool.get_connection so that the lock is
    not held while waiting for the socket to establish and validate the
    TCP connection.
  3.5.1
  * Fix for HSET argument validation to allow any non-None key. Thanks
    @AleksMat, #1337, #1341
  3.5.0
  * Removed exception trapping from __del__ methods. redis-py objects that
    hold various resources implement __del__ cleanup methods to release
    those resources when the object goes out of scope. This provides a
    fallback for when these objects aren't explicitly closed by user code.
    Prior to this change any errors encountered in closing these resources
    would be hidden from the user. Thanks @jdufresne. #1281
  * Expanded support for connection strings specifying a username connecting
    to pre-v6 servers. #1274
  * Optimized Lock's blocking_timeout and sleep. If the lock cannot be
    acquired and the sleep value would cause the loop to sleep beyond
    blocking_timeout, fail immediately. Thanks @clslgrnc. #1263
  * Added support for passing Python memoryviews to Redis command args that
    expect strings or bytes. The memoryview instance is sent directly to
    the socket such that there are zero copies made of the underlying data
    during command packing. Thanks @Cody-G. #1265, #1285
  * HSET command now can accept multiple pairs. HMSET has been marked as
    deprecated now. Thanks to @laixintao #1271
  * Don't manually DISCARD when encountering an ExecAbortError.
    Thanks @nickgaya, #1300/#1301
  * Reset the watched state of pipelines after calling exec. This saves
    a roundtrip to the server by not having to call UNWATCH within
    Pipeline.reset(). Thanks @nickgaya, #1299/#1302
  * Added the KEEPTTL option for the SET command. Thanks
    @laixintao #1304/#1280
  * Added the MEMORY STATS command. #1268
  * Lock.extend() now has a new option, `replace_ttl`. When False (the
    default), Lock.extend() adds the `additional_time` to the lock's existing
    TTL. When replace_ttl=True, the lock's existing TTL is replaced with
    the value of `additional_time`.
  * Add testing and support for PyPy.

==== python-urllib3 ====
Version update (1.25.9 -> 1.25.10)

- update to 1.25.10:
  * Added support for ``SSLKEYLOGFILE`` environment variable for
    logging TLS session keys with use with programs like
    Wireshark for decrypting captured web traffic (Pull #1867)
  * Fixed loading of SecureTransport libraries on macOS Big Sur
    due to the new dynamic linker cache (Pull #1905)
  * Collapse chunked request bodies data and framing into one
  call to ``send()`` to reduce the number of TCP packets by 2-4x (Pull #1906)
  * Don't insert ``None`` into ``ConnectionPool`` if the pool
    was empty when requesting a connection (Pull #1866)
  * Avoid ``hasattr`` call in ``BrotliDecoder.decompress()`` (Pull #1858)
