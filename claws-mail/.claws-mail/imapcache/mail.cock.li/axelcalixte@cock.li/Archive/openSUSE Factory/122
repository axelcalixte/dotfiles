=== Details ===

==== aaa_base ====
Version update (84.87+git20200507.e2243a4 -> 84.87+git20200708.f5e90d7)
Subpackages: aaa_base-extras

- Update to version 84.87+git20200708.f5e90d7:
  * check for Packages.db and use this instead of Packages
    (boo#1171762)
  * Add also support for /usr/etc/profile.d for tcsh
  * Do add some support for /usr/etc/profile.d

==== automake ====
Version update (1.16.1 -> 1.16.2)

- Fix name tag for multibuild
- Add etags to BuildRequires for testsuite
- Add automake-testsuite-vala-gcc10.patch: fixes testsuite
- Changed automake-SuSE.patch: updated for new version
- Update to 1.16.2. Changes since 1.16.1:
  * New features added
  - add zstd support and the automake option, dist-zstd.
  - support for Python 3: py-compile now supports both Python 3
    and Python 2; tests do not require .pyo files, and uninstall
    deletes __pycache__ correctly (automake bug #32088).
  * Miscellaneous changes
  - automake no longer requires a @setfilename in each .texi file
  * Bugs fixed
  - When cleaning the compiled python files, '\n' is not used anymore in the
    substitution text of 'sed' transformations.  This is done to preserve
    compatibility with the 'sed' implementation provided by macOS which
    considers '\n' as the 'n' character instead of a newline.
    (automake bug#31222)
  - For make tags, lisp_LISP is followed by the necessary space when
    used with CONFIG_HEADERS.
    (automake bug#38139)
  - The automake test txinfo-vtexi4.sh no longer fails when localtime
    and UTC cross a day boundary.
  - Emacsen older than version 25, which require use of
    byte-compile-dest-file, are supported again.
- convert testsuite to singlespec

==== bash ====
Subpackages: bash-doc bash-lang

- Add official patch bash50-018
  * In certain cases, bash does not perform quoted null removal on patterns
    that are used as part of word expansions such as ${parameter##pattern}, so
    empty patterns are treated as non-empty.

==== coreutils ====
Subpackages: coreutils-doc coreutils-lang

- Drop suse-module-tools BuildRequires: this was used for the macro
  regenerate_initrd_post/posttrans, which have been moved to
  rpm-config-SUSE in Jan 2019.

==== gcc10 ====
Version update (10.1.1+git290 -> 10.2.1+git465)
Subpackages: cpp10 gcc10-info gcc10-locale libasan6 libatomic1 libgcc_s1 libgcc_s1-32bit libgfortran5 libgomp1 libitm1 liblsan0 libobjc4 libquadmath0 libstdc++6 libstdc++6-32bit libstdc++6-devel-gcc10 libstdc++6-locale libstdc++6-pp-gcc10 libstdc++6-pp-gcc10-32bit libtsan0 libubsan1

- Update to gcc-10 branch head (c0438ced53bcf57e4ebb1c38c), git465.
  * Includes GCC 10.2 release.  [bsc#1173972] [jsc#ECO-2373]
  * Picks up fixes for C++20 coroutines support.  [jsc#SLE-12297]
  * Picks up fix for a recent chromium build fail.
- Build x86 CET enabled runtime for Factory.
- Disable GCN offloading for SLE12 and SLE15 GA.
- Update to gcc-10 branch head (12e1a54b06777db74ce375496), git355.
  * Includes fix for non-reproducible builds with LTO [bsc#1172846].
- Enable nvptx support for aarch64

==== libeconf ====
Version update (0.3.7+git20200605.c67ef9a -> 0.3.8+git20200710.5126fff)
Subpackages: libeconf0 libeconf0-32bit

- Update to version 0.3.8+git20200710.5126fff:
  * Add CMake build scripts, remove autotools support
  * Move C++ ABI compatibility section

==== mpfr ====
Version update (4.0.2 -> 4.1.0)

- Update to mpfr 4.1.0
  * New function mpfr_get_str_ndigits about conversion to a string of digits.
  * New function mpfr_dot for the dot product (incomplete, experimental).
  * New functions mpfr_get_decimal128 and mpfr_set_decimal128 (available only
    when MPFR has been built with decimal float support).
  * New function mpfr_cmpabs_ui.
  * New function mpfr_total_order_p for the IEEE 754 totalOrder predicate.
  * The mpfr_out_str function now accepts bases from -2 to -36, in order to
    follow mpfr_get_str and GMP's mpf_out_str functions (these cases gave an
    assertion failure, as with other invalid bases).
  * Shared caches: cleanup; really detect lock failures (abort in this case).
  * The behavior of the formatted output functions (mpfr_printf, etc.) with
    an empty precision field has improved: trailing zeros are kept in a way
    similar to the formatted output functions from C.
  * Improved mpfr_add and mpfr_sub when all operands have a precision equal to
    twice the number of bits per word, e.g., 128 bits on a 64-bit platform.
  * Optimized the tuning parameters for various architectures.
  * Improved test coverage to 98.6% of code for x86_64.
  * Bug fixes.
  * MPFR manual: corrected/completed the mpfr_get_str description in order to
    follow the historical behavior and GMP's mpf_get_str function.
- Remove mpfr-4.0.2-p6.patch and floating-point-format-no-lto.patch

==== nodejs14 ====

  jre#SES-1081), including:
